        <h1>About</h1>
        <p> I am a designer passionate about creating work that bridges innovation with impact. Currently studying at Virginia Commonwealth University and originally from Baltimore, Maryland, I approach design as both a researcher and a problem solver. My work is rooted in a commitment to user experience, accessibility, and the power of data visualization to tell clear, meaningful stories.</p>

        <p>I believe that thoughtful design can make information more accessible, systems more intuitive, and experiences more inclusive. Research drives my process, and I am always seeking new ways to understand complex problems and uncover human-centered solutions. Design, for me, is not just about aesthetics — it’s about making connections, solving real-world challenges, and shaping a better, more accessible future. </p>
